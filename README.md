# Marketing-Dataset

### SQL-Based Marketing Data Analysis  

This project involves analyzing a marketing dataset stored in PostgreSQLto extract key insights. The dataset includes information on campaign performance, impressions, clicks, acquisition costs, and conversion rates. The primary goal was to write efficient SQL queries to answer specific business questions and rank marketing channels.  

#### Key Tasks Performed:  
- **Data Preparation:** Ensured proper data formatting, including handling acquisition cost as a text field and converting it to numeric for calculations.
  
- **SQL Queries:** Executed eight queries covering total impressions, highest ROI campaign, location-based engagement, and CTR-based performance.
   
- **Data Validation:** Checked for missing values and ensured accuracy in calculated metrics like CTR and cost per conversion.
   
- **Result Documentation:** Stored SQL scripts and captured screenshots of query outputs for final reporting.  

#### Key Insights:
- **New York** had the highest impressions.
  
- **NexGen Systems** had the best ROI.
  
- **Email marketing** led in total conversions.
   
- CTR varied significantly across target audiences and marketing channels.

#### Recommendations: 
- Optimize campaigns based on high-performing channels and locations.
    
- Reduce acquisition costs for better ROI efficiency.
  
- Increase CTR benchmarks for future ad performance evaluations.  

Final deliverables include SQL scripts, query results, and a detailed report documenting insights.
